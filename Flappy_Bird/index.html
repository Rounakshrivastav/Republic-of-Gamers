      Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right.
       The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random.
        Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the upward key.
         Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point.
         Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.</P>
